# Images Directory

Place project screenshots and images here.

## Image Guidelines

- **Format**: JPG or PNG
- **Recommended size**: 800x600px or similar 4:3 aspect ratio
- **File naming**: Use lowercase with hyphens (e.g., `climate-explorer.jpg`)
- **File size**: Keep under 500KB for faster loading

## Usage

Reference images in your project JSON files:

```json
{
  "projectImage": "/images/your-project-name.jpg"
}
```

The `/images/` path refers to this `public/images/` directory.

## Placeholder

If you don't have a screenshot yet, you can:
1. Leave the `projectImage` field empty
2. Use a screenshot tool or browser DevTools to capture your project
3. Use a placeholder service temporarily: `https://via.placeholder.com/800x600`
